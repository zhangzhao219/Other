\section{Assumptions}

To simplify the problem, we make the following basic assumptions, each of which is properly justified.

\begin{itemize}
    \item[$\bullet$] Nutrients such as ground litter and woody fibers are only broken down by fungi and not broken down or consumed by other organisms.
    \item[$\bullet$] The maximum environmental capacity of the fungal community is constant over a period of time and only depends on the size of space and the amount of resources.
    \item[$\bullet$] After a fungus has been eliminated from the competition, it is likely to reappear if environmental conditions change.
    \item[$\bullet$] Even when different communities are not in direct contact, they are competing and interacting with each other all the time.
\end{itemize}
