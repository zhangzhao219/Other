\subsection{Restatement of the Problems}
\begin{itemize}
\item[$\bullet$] Build a mathematical model that describes the breakdown of ground litter and woody fibers through fungal activity in the presence of multiple species of fungi.
\item[$\bullet$] In your model, incorporate the interactions between different species of fungi, which have different growth rates and different moisture tolerances.

\item[$\bullet$] Provide an analysis of the model and describe the interactions between the different types of fungi. 

\item[$\bullet$] Include predictions about the relative advantages and disadvantages for each species and combinations of species likely to persist, and do so for different environments.

\item[$\bullet$] Describe how the diversity of fungal communities of a system impacts the overall efficiency of a system with respect to the breakdown of ground litter. Predict the importance and role of biodiversity in the presence of different degrees of variability in the local environment.
\end{itemize}
