\subsection{Background}
Ecosystem is an open system, both material and energy are constantly circulating and exchanging with the outside world. The cycle of matter and energy requires the joint efforts of producers and decomposers. Producers gather matter and energy in the system, while decomposers release them, which is crucial to the balance and development of the entire ecosystem. The diversity of fungi in the ecosystem is very rich and it plays an important role in maintaining the stability of the diversity of the ecosystem.It is of great significance and influence to study the development of the whole ecosystem to systematically study the decomposition models of fungi and analyze their roles in the ecosystem.
