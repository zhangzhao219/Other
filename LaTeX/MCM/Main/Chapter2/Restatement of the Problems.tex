\subsection{Restatement of the Problems}
Based on the analysis of the question and the attachment, we need to research the characteristics of the figures subject using zigzag parallel and contour parallel hatch, establish the mathematical model of hatching, design the algorithm, and then complete the following three questions:

\textbf{Question 1:} Realize the hatching of the single-layer contour pattern in Attachment 1 with two filling methods under two groups of input parameters, and calculate the total length of each filling curve, the number of horizontal lines of zigzag parallel hatch, and the number of circles of contour parallel hatch. Calculate the program running time ratio under parameter groups (2) and (1).

\textbf{Question 2:} Change the single-layer contour pattern in Attachment 1 of Question 1 to the mutually nested multi-layer contour patterns in Attachment 2, other conditions remain unchanged, and complete the relevant analysis and calculation.

\textbf{Question 3:} Check the elapsed time of hatching algorithm and analyze its performance to provide a strategy or direction for optimizing the performance and efficiency of the hatching algorithm.
