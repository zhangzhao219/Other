\subsection{Analysis of the Problem 5}
In order to describe how the diversity of fungal communities of a system impacts the overall efficiency of a system with respect to the breakdown of ground litter, it is necessary to consider the changes when different interactions (not only competition) between fungal communities coexist on the basis of the dynamic interaction model of the third question, analyze the relationship between the number of fungal species and decomposition efficiency, and simulate the variability of local environment by setting initial conditions.
