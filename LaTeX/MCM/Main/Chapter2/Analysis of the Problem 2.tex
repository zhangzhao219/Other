\subsection{Analysis of the Problem 2}
According to the research results of Nicky Lustenhouwer et al\upcite{Lustenhouwer11551}. in the attachment, it can be concluded that both the hyphal extension rate and the moisture trade-off are related to the decomposition rate, and there are specific interactions between them. To solve this question, we need to establish a model to combine these two interactions, and optimize the model by using the functional relationship between them while keeping the decomposition rate unchanged.
