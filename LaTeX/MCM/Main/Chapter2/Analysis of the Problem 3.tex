\subsection{Analysis of the Problem 3}
In the same living environment, space and resources are limited, so the interaction between different types of fungi is usually manifested as competition relationship, that is, competition between different populations. In this question, a dynamic interaction model based on Logistic model and Lotka-Voltrra model should be established, and the influence of atmospheric environment such as temperature and humidity on the interaction between different types of fungi should be realized by controlling the growth rate, the degree of inhibition, the environmental tolerance and other coefficients.
