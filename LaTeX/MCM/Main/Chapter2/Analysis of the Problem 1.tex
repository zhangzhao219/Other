\subsection{Analysis of the Problem 1}
We need to establish a "decomposition rate model", which focuses on describing the breakdown of ground litter and woody fibers through fungal activity in the presence of multiple species of fungi. In the process of building the model, we need to consider the influence of woody plant species, site, years decayed, mesh, sampling side, extension rate, temperature, humidity overlap degree, time and other independent variables that may affect the decomposition process on the decomposition rate, and take the decomposition rate as the dependent variable for fitting.
