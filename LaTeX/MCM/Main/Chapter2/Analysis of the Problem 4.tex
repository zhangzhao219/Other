\subsection{Analysis of the Problem 4}
This question needs to predict the relative advantages and disadvantages of possible species combinations and make reasonable predictions for different environments. Therefore, the influence of "dynamic fluctuations" can be considered on the basis of the model established in problem 3. We can add random disturbance factors and introduce a random population model to simulate the effects of different environments on the fungal population.
